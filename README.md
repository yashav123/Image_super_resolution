# Image_Super_Resolution

This project focuses on enhancing image quality through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By leveraging dimensionality reduction and deep learning techniques, the project explores optimal feature extraction and high-accuracy image classification.



Principal Component Analysis (PCA):~Performed PCA using NumPy and Matplotlib to identify the best-fit line for dimensionality reduction.

~Applied the Kernel Trick with Scikit-learn on simulated datasets (moon and circles) to analyze non-linear patterns.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Digit Recognition:
~Developed a CNN model to tackle the Handwritten Digit Recognition problem.

~Trained the model on the MNIST dataset, achieving 97.8% accuracy on 10,000 test images.
